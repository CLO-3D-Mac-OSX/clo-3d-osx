## What is CLO 3D?  

**CLO 3D** is a next-generation **3D garment design and simulation tool** that transforms how fashion professionals create, test, and visualize their collections. By merging digital design with physical accuracy, it enables designers to bring their creative visions to life in a fully virtual environment.  

With CLO 3D, users can design patterns, fit garments on customizable 3D avatars, and preview fabric movement in real time — all without producing a single physical prototype. Its realistic simulation engine replicates material stretch, drape, and weight, helping reduce sampling costs and environmental waste while improving design speed.  

The platform supports **pattern import and export**, giving seamless compatibility with traditional 2D CAD systems and Adobe Illustrator. CLO 3D also includes **animation and rendering tools**, allowing designers to showcase collections through lifelike motion videos and photorealistic imagery.  

Optimized for **Apple Silicon**, CLO 3D delivers high-speed rendering, responsive performance, and efficient memory handling for even the most detailed projects. From independent designers to global fashion houses, it’s the ultimate tool for modern digital fashion creation.
